            # Trello is very helpful tool for work organizing, allows you to have different<br/>
             Boards for different projects, to which you can invite different people.<br/>
            The Boards are then arranged into Lists with each List having a number of Cards,<br/>
             which you can choose to order by priority or date added. The cards themselves<br/>
              can contain attachments, checklists, due dates etc. As always, you or your team<br/>
               need to decide how you want to use it and then structure it accordingly.<br/>
            GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service, or that it’s a social networking<br/>
             site for programmers.manages and stores revisions of projects. Although it’s mostly<br/>
              used for code, Git could be used to manage any other type of file, such as Word<br/>
               documents or Final Cut projects. Think of it as a filing system for every draft<br/>
                of a document.
