            1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems<br/>
            and software –<br/>
            how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
            To choose about the right technology for a job is always on<br/>
             whats the demand and in which program can built it.<br/>

            List of objective criteria <br/>
            Size and type of the project and complexity of the tasks<br/>
            Development speed as well as cost and availability of IT experts<br/>
            Presence of development tools and ready-made solutions<br/>>
            Technical requirements, existence of detailed documentation<br/>
            Support costs<br/>
            Usually, IT projects are divided into 3 groups:<br/>
            Simple (business sites, landing pages, small online stores or<br/>
             applications) – such solutions are usually created with the help of<br/>
              CMS or ready-made templates.<br/>
            
            
            Medium (complex online stores and marketplaces, national-scale portals,<br/>
             various SaaS, advanced applications) – such projects are usually built<br/>
              around frameworks.<br/>
            
            
            Large (huge portals, social networks, innovative and non-trivial apps<br/>
             and integrated software systems) – the core of such projects is developed<br/>
              in a HL programming language.<br/>
            The choice of technology and project architecture depends on the long list of<br/>
             functional and non-functional demands.
