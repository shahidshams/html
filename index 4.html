    <p> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed –<br/>
         in making
            your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?<br/>
             E.g. Visual Studio Code,
            Trello 
            
            </p>
            <p> Yes visual studio code and trello is very useful.VS Code is really good<br/>
                 at allowing customization and extensibility. There are a ton of extensions<br/>
                  to use for all types of workflow enhancement. In particular, the user <br/>
                  snippets and keybindings really help me personalize the experience for my<br/>
                   developing style.<br/>
                    VS Code works really well with Typescript. I really like the linting and<br/>
                     IntelliSense that come with it. It makes the development process so much<br/>
                      faster!<br/>
                    Trello is a project management tool designed to help individuals and teams<br/>
                     collaborate better and keep their projects organized. They offer a freemium<br/>
                      model that lets users work with an unlimited number of boards, lists,<br/>
                       and cards. It can also be integrated with cross-functional departments
                    
                    </p>
        <p>
                2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
                Trello 
                
        </p>
        <p>
                Visual studio code and trello is very appropriate,made my work easy to manage<br/>
                 and easy to run codes and debug to see how that looks and run,these tools are<br/>
                  very useful and essential for making website or IT work.
        </p>
        <p>
                2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
                your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests
                of openness. What would you change? 
                
        </p>
        <p>
                I am happy with my website, due to lack of  time how much i learnt and  what<br/>
                 i did.there could be something more which i could do more but due to lack <br/>
                 of time i couldn't mange to reserch and find.<br/>

        </p>

                Select colours on background, i would like to put option that viewers could<br/>
                 change colour how they like to watch.<br/>
