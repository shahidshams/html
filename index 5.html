    <p>• 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
            productivity and e
            ffi
            ciency – could you have been more e
            ffi
            cient when making your
            website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
            
            
            </p>
            <p>
                    While building my website I used slack, trello and visual studio code.<br/>
                    all of three was very helpful and well functioning, with the help of slack<br/>
                     i was connected with my classmates if there was in question or any information<br/>
                      we was sending through slack.<br/>
Trello was best tool to make a plane for work. I planed my all work on<br/>
 trello before starting my website.is a very good plaing tool which can be<br/>
  use even for everyday life.<br/>
Visual studio code VS Code helps to be instantly productive with syntax <br/>
highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets,<br/>
 and more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and <br/>
 community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your <br/>
 code with ease.<br/>
These all tools was very beneficial and time consuming to built my project .<br/>
In team it would be more better because of sharing ideas and more better outcome.

                    3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency ?
                    
            </p>
            <p>
                    We could work in team to do our projects that would help us to share ideas<br/>
                     and cold learn more things form each other.team work is really helpfull<br/>
                      and make work more easy.
            </p>
            <p>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
                    would you do di
                    ff
                    erently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
         I like team work where everyone share there knowledge and ideas.<br/>
          Slack help to connect all member and they can ask questions in in group<br/>
           and direct to someone.

                    <p>
             3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.

                    </p>
                    <p>
      Testing digital solutions we can do in sevral methods
     Function of the browser:<br/>
       Often browsers can support different actions in different ways. For example,<br/>
        printing, page zooming, copy / paste, page resizing etc. It is worth testing<br/>
         some of these functions across the browsers to ensure the outcome is what is expected.<br/>

        Error message:<br/>
       Often, during development of a website, error messages, pop ups and pop outs (where a<br/>
        new tab is created within the browser) are used. Development of these for different<br/>
         browsers and screen sizes can sometimes be missed and often bears fruit when testing.<br/>
       Execute Bug Hunt:<
       At DeeperThanBlue, we use something called a Bug Hunt cycle. This is where, as a test team, we run through a number of user journeys across our available devices. We do this methodically, at the same time, to ensure that we can identify issues as we go.
