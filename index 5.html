                    To develope a website need to make a plane on trello to see everything clear <br/>

                     digital
                    projects to fail? Why?
                    
                    A few common risks for creative digital projects<br/>
                    1: Ineffective or low impact change management Organisation resistant to change <br?>
                    including key delivery departments – significant new processes and structures in<br/>
                     place that may cause short term resistance Mitigation: Educate, Inform and<br/>
                      communicate; above all else, listen
                    2: Too many committee decisions Artistic direction becomes muddied due to too many<br/>
                     stakeholders Mitigation: In the end something that is creative needs creative <br?>
                     direction. Identify who does that straight from the go and define their influence<br/>
                      and make it clear to everyone, that they are the final arbiter.
                    3: Differing departmental requirements Will delay launch and cause unsatisfied<br?>
                     internal customers; following changes will cost more money. Mitigation: try to<br?>
                      understand what they actually need not what they say they need
                    4: Project resources may be reallocated for other (higher) priority projects<br?>
                     Resources are currently committed to this project. Losing a resource would severely<br?>
                      delay project. Mitigation: Plan ahead and understand the rhythm of the business, where<br?>
                       key events happen<br/>
                    5: Departmental Capacity Too much to do, day-to-day tasks getting the way; not enough<br?>
                     people or time and this project getting the way of BAU Mitigation: Understand <br/>
                    workflows and demands, identify potential bottlenecks<br?>
                    6: Inputs from departments will not be available when required Internal<br/>
                     processes and workflows aren’t up to producing content on time. Mitigation:<br?>
