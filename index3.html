    <h4>• 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
    <p># In modern business companies rely on IT for fast communications,<br />
         data processing and market intelligence. IT plays an integral role in <br/>
         every industry, helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost<br/>
          efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in<br/>
           the marketplace.
        </p><p> • 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
                successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What
                Skills?
                </p>
                <p> # To do digital project need to have skills of coding,<br/>
                     networking, communication, time management .
                        One of the basic skill sets an employer will look <br/>
                        for in an IT professional is the ability to write code.<br/>
                         If the job is programming or software/web development, an<br/>
                          employer may seek a candidate that can code in several different<br/>
                           languages, as many systems are built using more than just one language.
                        Application Development<br/>

                        <p>• 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?
                                Include a link to your Trello board.

                                         digital
                                        projects to fail? Why?
                                        
                                        A few common risks for creative digital projects<br/>
                                        1: Ineffective or low impact change management Organisation resistant to change <br?>
                                        including key delivery departments – significant new processes and structures in<br/>
                                         place that may cause short term resistance Mitigation: Educate, Inform and<br/>
                                          communicate; above all else, listen
                                        2: Too many committee decisions Artistic direction becomes muddied due to too many<br/>
                                         stakeholders Mitigation: In the end something that is creative needs creative <br?>
                                         direction. Identify who does that straight from the go and define their influence<br/>
                                          and make it clear to everyone, that they are the final arbiter.
                                        3: Differing departmental requirements Will delay launch and cause unsatisfied<br?>
                                         internal customers; following changes will cost more money. Mitigation: try to<br?>
                                          understand what they actually need not what they say they need
                                        4: Project resources may be reallocated for other (higher) priority projects<br?>
                                         Resources are currently committed to this project. Losing a resource would severely<br?>
                                          delay project. Mitigation: Plan ahead and understand the rhythm of the business, where<br?>
                                           key events happen<br/>
                                        5: Departmental Capacity Too much to do, day-to-day tasks getting the way; not enough<br?>
                                         people or time and this project getting the way of BAU Mitigation: Understand <br/>
                                        workflows and demands, identify potential bottlenecks<br?>
                                        6: Inputs from departments will not be available when required Internal<br/>
                                         processes and workflows aren’t up to producing content on time. Mitigation:<br?>

                                and software –<br/>
                                how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?<br/>

                                 whats the demand and in which program can built it.<br/>
                    
                                List of objective criteria <br/>
                                Size and type of the project and complexity of the tasks<br/>
                                Development speed as well as cost and availability of IT experts<br/>
                                Presence of development tools and ready-made solutions<br/>>
                                Technical requirements, existence of detailed documentation<br/>
                                Support costs<br/>
                                Usually, IT projects are divided into 3 groups:<br/>
                                Simple (business sites, landing pages, small online stores or<br/>
                                 applications) – such solutions are usually created with the help of<br/>
                                  CMS or ready-made templates.<br/>
                                
                                
                                Medium (complex online stores and marketplaces, national-scale portals,<br/>
                                 various SaaS, advanced applications) – such projects are usually built<br/>
                                  around frameworks.<br/>
                                
                                
                                Large (huge portals, social networks, innovative and non-trivial apps<br/>
                                 and integrated software systems) – the core of such projects is developed<br/>
                                  in a HL programming language.<br/>
                                The choice of technology and project architecture depends on the long list of<br/>
                                 functional and non-functional demands.

                                1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you<br/>
                                achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub<br/>

                                # Trello is very helpful tool for work organizing, allows you to have different<br/>
                                 Boards for different projects, to which you can invite different people.<br/>
                                The Boards are then arranged into Lists with each List having a number of Cards,<br/>
                                 which you can choose to order by priority or date added. The cards themselves<br/>
                                  can contain attachments, checklists, due dates etc. As always, you or your team<br/>
                                   need to decide how you want to use it and then structure it accordingly.<br/>
                                GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service, or that it’s a social networking<br/>
                                 site for programmers.manages and stores revisions of projects. Although it’s mostly<br/>
                                  used for code, Git could be used to manage any other type of file, such as Word<br/>
                                   documents or Final Cut projects. Think of it as a filing system for every draft<br/>
                                    of a document.

                                1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects<br/>
                                 – How does
                                GDPR impact digital projects?
                                
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                # GDPR is set to impact digital marketing is data processing.<br/>
                                 Digital marketers will only be able to process the data they really<br/>
                                  need, requiring legal justification for why the personal data <br/>
                                  they’ve collected is being processed.<br/>
                                In a blog post on the topic, Steve MacDonald explains why this isn’t<br/>
                                 as bad as it sounds. Steven recommends that marketers “need to focus on<br/>
                                  the data you need, and stop asking for the ‘nice to haves’.”<br/>
                                Indeed, 42% of B2B marketers believe that a lack of quality data is the<br/>
                                 biggest barrier to lead generation. Focusing on the data that really<br/>
                                  matters should be beneficial for both digital marketers and individuals
